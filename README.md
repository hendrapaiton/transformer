Data Transformation using Pandas, case study is jobs request in upwork.


## Job Requirements

We're looking for a Python developer who can help us every now and then with some data transformation. 

We have the following data structure (with more columns but exactly the same logic):

![Pciture 1](https://github.com/hendrapaiton/transformer/blob/main/img/Picture1.png?raw=true)

We need to get into this structure: 

![Pciture 2](https://github.com/hendrapaiton/transformer/blob/main/img/Picture2.png?raw=true)

Ideally the column names should not be hard-coded but rather dynamic using e.g. pd.endswith() to identify column names that end in “tCO2” or “verified by”.

Let us know if you can help with this - we might have some more similar tasks coming up in the future.
