# About Project

Data Transformation using Pandas, case study is jobs request in upwork.


## Job Requirements

We're looking for a Python developer who can help us every now and then with some data transformation. 

We have the following data structure (with more columns but exactly the same logic):

![Pciture 1](https://github.com/hendrapaiton/transformer/blob/main/img/Picture1.png?raw=true)

We need to get into this structure: 

![Pciture 2](https://github.com/hendrapaiton/transformer/blob/main/img/Picture2.png?raw=true)

Ideally the column names should not be hard-coded but rather dynamic using e.g. pd.endswith() to identify column names that end in “tCO2” or “verified by”.

Let us know if you can help with this - we might have some more similar tasks coming up in the future.


## Work Result

You can review my work result in [result.csv](https://github.com/hendrapaiton/transformer/blob/main/result.csv) files. I'm processing data using pandas to transform and load it to CSV files. You can view the data result as the same as the client's request in the example picture above. So if you have a task like this too, don't hesitate to hire me. Thanks.
